Customer Clustering â€“ Unsupervised Learning Project
Overview
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment while pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and Analytics. The objective was to apply unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior, aiding in targeted marketing strategies and customer relationship management.

Author
This project was solely developed by Dewao. All aspects, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and visualization, were completed independently to enhance my practical skills in clustering algorithms and data analysis.

Purpose
The main goals of this project are to:

Understand and apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to real-world data.

Identify distinct customer segments based on behavioral patterns.

Visualize clusters to interpret and communicate insights effectively.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and can be accessed here:
